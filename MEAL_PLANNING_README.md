# Meal Planning System with Edamam Integration

This document describes the comprehensive meal planning system that integrates with Edamam APIs to generate personalized meal plans based on your clients' EER (Estimated Energy Requirement) requirements.

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

The meal planning system consists of several key components:

1. **Edamam Service** (`lib/edamamService.ts`) - Handles all API interactions with Edamam
2. **Meal Planning Service** (`lib/mealPlanningService.ts`) - Core business logic for meal plan generation
3. **Database Tables** - Store meal plans, meals, and feedback
4. **API Endpoints** - RESTful endpoints for meal plan management
5. **Integration** - Seamlessly works with existing EER calculations

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema

### New Tables Added

#### `meal_plans`
- Stores generated meal plans with nutrition targets
- Links to clients and nutritionists
- Tracks plan status and preferences

#### `meal_plan_meals`
- Individual meals within a plan
- Contains recipe data from Edamam
- Calculated nutrition per serving and total

#### `meal_plan_feedback`
- Client feedback and ratings
- Tracks satisfaction and preferences

## üîß Setup & Configuration

### 1. Environment Variables

Add these to your `.env.local` file:

```bash
# Edamam API Credentials
EDAMAM_APP_ID=your_edamam_app_id
EDAMAM_APP_KEY=your_edamam_app_key
```

### 2. Database Migration

Run the new migration to create meal planning tables:

```bash
# The migration file is: database/migrations/035_create_meal_planning_tables.sql
# This will be automatically applied when you deploy
```

## üöÄ API Endpoints

### Generate Meal Plan

**POST** `/api/meal-plans`

Generates a complete meal plan for a client based on their EER requirements.

```json
{
  "clientId": "uuid-of-client",
  "planDate": "2024-01-15",
  "planType": "daily",
  "dietaryRestrictions": ["vegetarian", "gluten-free"],
  "cuisinePreferences": ["italian", "mediterranean"],
  "mealPreferences": {
    "breakfast": ["quick", "protein-rich"],

        "ingredients": ["banana", "protein powder", "almond milk"]
      }
      // ... more meals
    ],
    "nutritionSummary": {
      "totalCalories": 1985,
      "totalProtein": 148,
      "totalCarbs": 198,
      "totalFat": 65
    }
  }
}
```

### Get Client Meal Plans

**GET** `/api/meal-plans?clientId=uuid-of-client`

Retrieves all meal plans for a specific client.

### Get Specific Meal Plan

**GET** `/api/meal-plans/{id}`

Retrieves a specific meal plan by ID.

### Update Meal Plan Status

**PUT** `/api/meal-plans/{id}`

Updates the status of a meal plan.

```json
{
  "status": "active"
}
```

Valid statuses: `draft`, `active`, `completed`, `archived`

### Delete Meal Plan

**DELETE** `/api/meal-plans/{id}`

Deletes a meal plan and all associated meals.

### Search Recipes

**GET** `/api/recipes/search`

Search for recipes using various criteria.

**Query Parameters:**
- `query` - Search term (e.g., "chicken pasta")
- `diet` - Dietary restrictions (e.g., `["vegetarian", "gluten-free"]`)
- `health` - Health labels (e.g., `["low-sodium", "high-protein"]`)
- `cuisineType` - Cuisine preferences (e.g., `["italian", "indian"]`)
- `mealType` - Meal type (e.g., `["breakfast", "lunch"]`)
- `calories` - Calorie range (e.g., `"300-500"`)
- `time` - Cooking time (e.g., `"0-30"`)
- `imageSize` - Image size preference (`THUMBNAIL`, `SMALL`, `REGULAR`, `LARGE`)

## üßÆ How It Works

### 1. EER Integration
- Automatically retrieves client's calculated EER requirements
- Uses stored protein, carbs, fat, and fiber targets
- Respects dietary preferences and restrictions

### 2. Meal Distribution
The system distributes nutrition targets across meals:
- **Breakfast**: 25% of daily targets
- **Lunch**: 35% of daily targets  
- **Dinner**: 35% of daily targets
- **Snack**: 5% of daily targets

### 3. Recipe Selection
- Searches Edamam API for suitable recipes
- Filters by nutrition targets (¬±20% tolerance)
- Considers dietary restrictions and preferences
- Optimizes serving sizes to meet targets

### 4. Nutrition Calculation
- Calculates total nutrition for the entire plan
- Provides percentage breakdown of macros
- Ensures targets are met within reasonable ranges

## üéØ Features

### Smart Recipe Matching
- **Nutrition-based filtering** - Recipes must meet macro targets
- **Dietary compliance** - Respects vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, etc.
- **Cuisine preferences** - Can focus on specific cuisines
- **Cooking time** - Considers preparation time preferences

### Flexible Preferences

## üìä Example Usage

### Generate a Daily Meal Plan

```javascript
const response = await fetch('/api/meal-plans', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    clientId: 'client-uuid',
    planDate: '2024-01-15',
    planType: 'daily',
    dietaryRestrictions: ['vegetarian'],
    cuisinePreferences: ['mediterranean', 'italian']
  })
});

const { mealPlan } = await response.json();
console.log(`Generated plan with ${mealPlan.meals.length} meals`);
```

### Search for Quick Breakfast Recipes

```javascript
const response = await fetch('/api/recipes/search?mealType=breakfast&time=0-15&diet=vegetarian&imageSize=REGULAR', {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`
  }
});

const { results } = await response.json();
console.log(`Found ${results.hits.length} quick vegetarian breakfast recipes`);
```

## üö® Error Handling

The system includes comprehensive error handling:

- **Validation errors** - Invalid dates, missing fields
- **API errors** - Edamam API failures, rate limits
- **Database errors** - Connection issues, constraint violations
- **Authorization errors** - Invalid tokens, insufficient permissions

## üîí Security Features

- **Authentication required** - All endpoints require valid JWT tokens
- **Client ownership** - Nutritionists can only access their own clients' data
- **Input validation** - Comprehensive validation of all inputs
- **SQL injection protection** - Uses parameterized queries

## üìà Performance Considerations

- **Efficient queries** - Optimized database indexes
- **API caching** - Edamam responses can be cached
- **Batch operations** - Bulk meal plan operations
- **Async processing** - Non-blocking meal plan generation
